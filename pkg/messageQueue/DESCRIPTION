Description: This package creates a simple way to interact with message queues regardless of the underlying provider of the queue (activeMQ or rabbitMQ).  The idea is to provide this basic functionality such that R doesn't need to deal with the specifics of queues or their underlying implementation differences.  Provides a simple way to PUT a text message on a queue and GET a text message from a queue.
